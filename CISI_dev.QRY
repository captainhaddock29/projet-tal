Most resources have been spent on applying information retrieval
techniques to the physical and medical sciences.  But, has information
retrieval been used at all in the natural sciences, social sciences,
and humanities?  If so, what have been some of the problems which have
been encountered with these subject areas and how have they been
solved, if at all?  Have the characteristics of these subject areas
necessitated the development of new information retrieval techniques?
What are the prospcts for future machine control in these areas?

like descriptions of both general and specific applications of
automation in such areas as circulation, cataloging, acquisitions,

the operation of a conventional public or university library, or
practices in a special library which could also be applied in a public
or university library.  Give descriptions of equipment and operations,

The Selection of Good Search Terms
.A
van Rijsbergen, C.J.
Harper, D.J.
Porter, M.F.
.W
    This paper tackles the problem of how one might select further search terms,
using relevance feedback, given the search terms in the query.  These search
terms are extracted from a maximum spanning tree connecting all the terms in the
index term vocabulary.  A number of different spanning trees are generated from
a variety of association measures.  The retrieval effectiveness for the
different spanning trees is shown to be approximately the same.  Effectiveness
is measured in terms of precision and recall, and the retrieval tests are done
on three different test collections.

A Translating Computer Interface for End-User Operation of
Heterogeneous Retrieval Systems.  II. Evaluations
.A
Marcus, R.S.
Reintjes, J.F.
.W
    The evaluation of the concept of a translating compuyter interface for
simplifying operation of multiple, heterogenous online bibliographic
retrieval systems has been undertaken.  An experimental retrieval system,
named CONIT, was built and tested under controlled conditions with
inexperienced end users.  A detailed analysis of the experimental usages
showed that users were able to master interface operation sufficiently well
to find relevant document references.  Success was attributed, in part,
to a simple command language, adequate online instruction, and a simplified
natural-language, keyword/stem approach to searching.  It is concluded that
operational interfaces of the type studied can provide for increased usability
of existing system in a cost effective manner, especially for searchers.
Furthermore, more advanced interfaces based on improved instruction and
automated search strategy techniques could further enhance retrieval
effectiveness for a wide class of users.

A Model of Cluster Searching Based on Classification
.A
Croft, W.B.
.W
    The use of document clusters has been suggested as an efficient file
organization for a document retrieval system.  It is possible that by
using this information about the relationships between documents that the
effectiveness of the system (i.e., its ability to distinguish relevant
from non-relevant documents) may also be improved.  In this paper a
probabilistic model of cluster searching  based on query classification is
described.  This model is tested with retrieval experiments which indicate
that it can be more effective than heuristic cluster searches and cluster
searches based on other models.  It can also be more effective than a full
search in which every document is compared to the query.  The efficiency
aspects of the implementation of the model are discussed.

Performance Testing of a Book and Its Index as a Information Retrieval
System
.A
Bennion, B.C.
.W
    The retrieval performance of book indexes can be measured in terms of
their ability to direct a user selectively to text material whose identity
but not location is known.  The method requires human searchers to base
their searching strategies on actual passages from the book rather than on
test queries, natural or contrived.  It circumvents the need for relevance
judgement, but still yields performance indicators that correspond
approximately to the recall and precision ratios of large document retrieval
system evaluation.  A preliminary application of the method to the subject
indexing of two major encyclopedias showed one encyclopedia apparently
superior in both the finding and discrimination abilities of retrieval
performance.  The method is presently best suited for comparative testing
since its ability to yield absolute or reproducible measures is as yet not
established.

Text Passage Retrieval Based on Colon Classification:  Retrieval Performance
.A
Shepherd, M.A.
.W
    A set of experiments was conducted to determine the suitability of the
Colon Classification as a foundation for the automated analysis, representation
and retrieval of primary information from the full text of documents.  Primary
information is that information embodied in the text of a document, as opposed
to secondary information which is generally in such forms as:  an abstract, a
table of contents, or an index.
    Full text databases were created in two subject areas and queries solicited
from specialists in each area.  An automated full text indexing system, along
with four automated passage retrieval systems, was created to test the various
features of the Colon Classification.  Two Boolean-based systems and one simple
word occurrence system were created in order to compare the retrieval results
against types of systems which are in more common use.  The systems' retrieval
performances were measured using recall and precision and the mean expected
search length reduction factors.
    Overall, it was found that the Colon Classification-based systems did not
perform significantly better than the other systems.

Interacting in Natural Language With Artificial Systems:  The Donau Project
.A
Guida, G.
Somalvico, M.
.W
    This paper is intended to propose a new methodological approach to
the conception and development of natural language understanding systems.
This new contribution is supported by the design, implementation, and
experimentation of DONAU:  a general purpose domain oriented natural
language understanding system developed and presently running at the Milan
Polytechnic Artificial Intelligence Project.  The system is based on a two
level modular architecture intended to overcome the lack of flexibility and
generality often pointed out in many existing systems, and to facilitate
the exchange of results and actual experiences between different projects.
The horizontal level allows an independent and parallel development of the
single segments of the system (syntactic analyser, information extractor,
legality controller).  The vertical level ensures the possibility of changing
(enlarging or redefining) the definition of the semantic domain on which each
particular version of the system is oriented and specialized in a simple,
incremental, and user-oriented way.  In the paper the general architecture of
the system and the mode of operation of each segment are illustrated in
detail.  Linguistic models, knowledge representation, and parsing algorithms
are described and illustrated by means of selected examples.  Performance
evaluations of the system in the application version on data base inquiry are
reported and discussed.  Promising directions for future research are presented
in the conclusions.

A General Formulation of Bradford's Distribution:  The Graph-Oriented
Approach
.A
Asai, I.
.W
    From the detailed analysis of eight previously published mathematical
models, a general formulation of Bradford's distribution can be deduced as
follows:  y = a log(x + c) + b, where y is the ratio of the cumulative
frequency of articles to the total number of articles and x is the ratio
of the rank of journals to the total number of journals.  The parameters a, b,
and c are the slope, the intercept, and the shift in a straight line to log rank,
respectively.  Each of the eight models is a special case of the general
formulation and is one of five types of formulation.  In order to estimate
three unknown parameters, a statistical method using root-weighted square
error is proposed.  A comparative experiment using 11 databases suggests that
the fifth type of formulation with three unknown parameters is the best fit
to the observed data.  A further experiment shows that the deletion of the
droop data leads to a more accurate value of parameters and less error.

The Use of Titles for Automatic Document Classification
.A
Hamill, K.A.
Zamora, A.
.W
    An experimental computer program has been developed to classify
documents according to the 80 sections and five major section groupings of
Chemical Abstracts (CA).  The program uses pattern recognition techniques
supplemented by heuristics.  During the "training" phase, words from
pre-classified documents are selected, and the probability of occurrence
of each word in each section of CA is computed and stored in a reference
dictionary.  The "classification" phase matches each word of a document
title against the dictionary and assigns a section number to the document
using weights derived from the probabilities in the dictionary.  Heuristic
techniques are used to normalize word variants such as plurals, past
tenses, and gerunds in both the training phase and the classification
phase.  The dictionary lookup technique is supplemented by the analysis of
chemical nomenclature terms into their component word roots to influence
the section to which the documents are assigned.  Program performance and
human consistency have been evaluated by comparing the program results
against the published sections of CA and by conducting an experiment with
people experienced in the assignment of documents to CA sections.  The
program assigned approximately 78% of the documents to the correct major
section groupings of CA and 67% of the correct sections or cross-references
at a rate of 100 documents per second.

Adaptive Design for Decision Support Systems
.A
Keen, P.G.W.
.W
    Decision Support Systems (DSS) represent a concept of the role of
computers within the decision making process.  The term has become a
rallying cry for researchers, practitioners, and managers concerned that
Management Science and Management Information Systems fields have become
unnecessarily narrow in focus.  As with many rallying cries, the term is
not well defined.  For some writers, DSS simply mean interactive systems
for use by managers.  To others, the key issue is support, rather than
system.  They focus on understanding and improving the decision process;
a DSS is then designed using any available and suitable technology. Some
researchers view DSS as a subfield of MIS, while others regard it as an
extension of Management Science techniques.  The former define Decision
Support as providing managers with access to data and the latter as giving
them access to analytic models.

    The key argument of this paper is that the term DSS is relevant to
situations where a "final" system can be developed only through an
adaptive process of learning and evolution.  The design strategy must
then focus on getting finished; this is very different from Management
Science and Data Processing approaches.  The research issued for DSS
center around adaption and evolution; they include managerial learning
representation of tasks and user behavior, design architecture and
strategies for getting started.

User-Responsive Subject Control in Bibliographic Retrieval Systems

    A study was carried out of the relationship between the vocabulary of

the value of adding to the document description record in a retrieval system
keywords from previous queries for which the document had proved useful.
Two test databases incorporating user query keywords were implemented at
the School of Library and Information Science, University of Western
Ontario.  Clustering of the documents via title and user keywords, a
statistical analysis of title-user keyword co-occurrences, and retrieval
tests were used to examine the effect of the added keywords.  Results
showed the impracticality of the procedure in an operational setting, but
indicated the value of analyses with sample data in the development and
maintenance of keyword dictionaries and thesauri.

Feature Comparison of an In-House Information Retrieval System With a
Commercial Search Service

Boyle, S.O.
Miller, A.P.
.W
    A commercially available online search was used as a standard for
comparative searching and evaluation of an in-house information system
based on automatic indexing.  System features were identified and
evaluated on the basis of their usefulness in various kinds of searching,
their ease in implementation, and how they are influenced by differences
in user type or specific applications.  Some common features of the
commercial system, such as online instruction, user-specified print formats,
dictionary display, and truncation, are seen to be unnecessary or
impractical for the in-house system.  In designing the in-house system,
therefore, detald consideration must be given to the applications,
operating environment, and real user needs.  While a commercial system can
serve as a useful standard for comparative evaluation, one must be
careful not to attempt to duplicate it blindly in-house.

Cocited Author Retrieval Online:
An Experiment with the Social Indicators Literature
.A
White, H.D.
.W
    One mode of online retrieval in Scisearch or Social Scisearch involves
entering pairs of authors' names believed to be jointly cited by
subsequent writers and retrieving papers in which cocitations occur.  Six
pairs were formed with the names of four authors prominent in the social
indicators movement (Bauer, Duncan, Land, and Sheldon).  Documents by the
four were not specified.  It was thought that the pair Duncan and Land
would retrieve papers in which indicator-type data would be integrated with
path-analytic causal modeling.  All other pairs seemed likely to retrieve a
"general social indicators" literature.  The 298 retrieved papers confirmed
expectattions.  It was found that 121 papers generally cited social indicators
(SI) documents by the input authors and frequently had SI language in
their titles.  Other signs of content also identified them as papers of
the SI movement.  The 177 papers retrieved on Duncan and Land generally
cited causal modeling documents by the input pair and were path-analytic
in nature.  As expected, they were relatively "harder" than the first
group of papers, although the two groups are akin and are formally linked
through citations in certain papers.  An additional result is that papers
citing at least three of the input authors tend to be overviews of the SI
movement.

primary result of the project is the creation of a completely operational
facility, including all equipment, software, procedures, and data bases

    A technique is described for automatic reformulation of boolean
queries.  Based on patron relevance judgements of an initial retrieval,
prevalence measures are derived for terms appearing in the retrieved set

construction of a boolean query for a subsequent retrieval.  To illustrate
the technique, a series of tests is described of its application to a small
data base in an experimental environment.  Results compare favourably with
feedback as employed in a SMART-type system.  MOre extensive testing is
